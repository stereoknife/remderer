# remderer
A bad opengl renderer

# Roadmap
1. Get something to render
2. Make a UI to tweak things
3. Get something to render but nicer (pbr)
4. Maybe ssao? just copying features from uni project

# Where to go then? idk some ideas
- Opengl wrapper ???
- S-cene editor :)
- Rays????
- Move opengl wrapper to zig??? to figure out how c interop works ????
- Swift and metal, maybe, too
