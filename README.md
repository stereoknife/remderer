# remderer
An opengl renderer that aims to unify my previous [PBR](https://github.com/stereoknife/PBR) and [SSAO](https://github.com/stereoknife/SSAO) assignments from uni. I'm currently still working on getting the OpenGL stuff set up but I haven't had much time for it due to work and other uni work. In the meantime you can check out the other projects above.

# Roadmap
1. Get something to render
2. Make a UI to tweak things
3. Get something to render but nicer (pbr)
4. SSAO
